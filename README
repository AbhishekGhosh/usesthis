The Setup is a website with nerdy interviews asking people what they use to get the job done. It's made up oftwo little Sinatra apps:

	/site/ is the actual interview site.
	/admin/ is a (not-quite-finished) AtomPub-based admin site.

Interested in cloning the site for your own interviews, similar or otherwise? HELL YEAH! These are the questions I email people:

    1) Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)
    2) What hardware do you use?
    3) And what software?
    4) What would be your dream setup?

If you *do* make your own version, please send me a note so I can check it out. :)

Love,
