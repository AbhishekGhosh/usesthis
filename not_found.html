<h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>
<p>I'm an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" title="The Wikipedia entry for 404.">error message</a> you receive when the page you're after can't be found online. It keeps me busy, that's for sure.</p>
<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>
<p>Some sort of rack-mounted device, I suppose. Or, I don't know, a freaking <em>Macbook Pro</em>?</p>
<h3>And what software?</h3>
<p>An HTTP server. Also, TextMate 2. HA HA HA!</p>
<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>
<p>This is pretty much it. I'd prefer it if people were more careful with what they typed into their web browsers, really. I could do with a holiday.</p>
