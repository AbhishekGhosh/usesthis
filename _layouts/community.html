<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Some awesome people have taken the time to make localised Setup-style sites, picking the brains of the people around them. Others have written up personal interviews with themselves. They're listed here.</p>

<h3>Localised or inspired by</h3>
<ul>
{% for link in page.links.inspired %}
	<li><a href="{{link.url}}" title="View {{link.name}}.">{{link.name}}</a> <span class="summary">({{link.summary}})</span></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h3>Personal</h3>
<ul>
{% for link in page.links.personal %}
	<li><a href="{{link.url}}" title="View the self-interview by {{link.name}}.">{{link.name}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
